        <h2>About swimming üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h2>

            <p><em>Swimming is a complete workout for bodies. <br> 
            You can swim not only in the pool, but also in lakes, rivers and ocean. <br>
            Swimming helps relieve stress, relax the mind and helps to stay cool during summers.<br>

        <h2>Why i love it? ‚ù§Ô∏è</h2>

            <p><em> For me swimming is the best thing in the world. I started when i was about a year <br>
            I feel very close to the element water, if i could probably i would live all the day inside swimming around. <br> 
            I have the best memories at the sea, spending summer's holiday with my grandparents. That's why i love it so much. <br>
            One of my biggest dreams is to live in Spain, near the coast. <br>
            I would like to try snorkeling one day but i still didn't find the right place for doing it near me.</p></em></p>
