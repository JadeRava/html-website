            <h2>About PingPong üèì</h2>
            
                <p><em>Ping pong, is a sport where two players fight each others on a table divided by a net. <br>
                They have to hit a little ball very light with rackets. <br>
                Even if it seems very easy, it requires speed and high reflexes. It's also an Olimpic's sport</em></p>
    
            <h2>Why i like it? ‚ù§Ô∏è</h2>
        
                <p><em>I love playing ping pong because it's fun and never bored me. <br>
                I play with my partner all the time and it's very funny because we challenge each other and the loser has to pay something to the winner.<br>
                That helps to make everything more funny. </em></p>
